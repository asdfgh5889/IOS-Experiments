# IOS-Experiments
Here you can find my various IOS experiment components (UI elments, loaders, Networkd controllers etc.)

In the experiments folder you can find:
- Zoom: It add zoom capabilities for collection view with images.
- WinLoader: It is loader view like in Windows 10. There you can find both loader itself and ViewLoader which can add loader layer to any view.
- Stepper: It is simple stepper with round buttons.
- ShowAnywhere: Show given view on top of where you want to show it. Like alert view
- Network: Some of mine network controller which can work with json and http request.
- LoaderButton: Button with loader, when button is pressed it will show loader inside of button.

Not best implementations, but I keep imporving them all. These all just experiments of mine, when they will be ready I will create seperate repos for each of them.
